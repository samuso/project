Summary of work:
	* Out of the big hp file I have extracted a data set which includes, year, msoacode, price.
	This is per every msoa per every year.
	
	* Out of the big airbnb file I have extracted a data set which includes, year, msoacode, airbnbzscore.
	This is per every msoa per every year.

	* From the year, msoacode, price file made under point 1, I normalized the data to get year, msoacode, pricezscore
